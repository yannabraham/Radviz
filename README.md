# Radviz

The Radviz package implements the concept of dimensional anchors to visualize multivariate datasets in a 2D projection, as originally described in [Hoffman *et al* 1999](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.135.889).

Radviz can be installed using the following command

```
devtools::install_github('yannabraham/Radviz')
```
